      "\n",
      "First, I need to find out where RBC's headquarters is located. Looking at the provided context, it mentions that RBC has its headquarters in Toronto, Ontario, and a head office in Montreal, Quebec. There's also a mention of the Royal Bank Plaza in Toronto being the operational headquarters. So, the main headquarters is in Toronto, Ontario.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the question refers to Sam Altman's brother's company. Wait, Sam Altman is the CEO of OpenAI, but who is his brother? I recall that Sam Altman has a brother named Jack Altman, who is the CEO of Lattice, a HR software company. So, the company in question here is likely Lattice. Now, I need to find out where Lattice's headquarters is located. However, the provided context doesn't mention anything about Sam Altman's brother or his company. The context only talks about RBC, its offices, and some other unrelated information like countries in Africa and RBC Capital Markets offices in the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the context doesn't provide any information about Sam Altman's brother's company or its headquarters location, I can't determine the geographical relationship between the two. To answer the question, I need both locations to compare their latitudes. Without knowing where Lattice's headquarters is, I can't say whether RBC's Toronto headquarters is north of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the status should be 'INCOMPLETE' because the necessary information about Sam Altman's brother's company's headquarters is missing. The useful information here is the location of RBC's headquarters in Toronto, but the missing part is the location of the other company's headquarters.\n",
